# Pac - Man is in Demand!
<h4>Pac - Man replicates his way through JavaScript<h4>
    
Description: A Pac - Man is supposed to be created instantaneously when you click on the "Add Pac - Man" button. Once you click the "Start Game" button that Pac - Man and any additional Pac - Men should continue that action of bouncing around the screen.
  
How to Run: There are starter files that include 4 images of Pac - Man along with the index.html and the Pacmen.js file. With these files you can set up the layout to make the game run the way it was meant to be played. The outcome of the game is to add as many Pac - Men as you like and when you hit "Start Game" and watch as many as you can bounce around the screen.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: I plan to improve this project by making a couple of changes. I want to see how it would look if the Pac - Men actually opened and       closed it's mouth more like an actual Pac-Man would behave instead of it just floating around with on face. I would just have to implement all 4 of the images and       set the parameters to open its mouth and close its mouth to one end of the screen and then when it hits the opposite end of the screen to reverse direction and           open and close its mouth in the opposite direction until it hits the other end of the screen. It should continue that process repeatedly or until a specific             amount of time is reached.
